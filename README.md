# SkyFallAnalysis
The file to train and evaluate the model is named ModelTrainAndFigs.m , while threshold based method is TBtechnique.m and the analysis about the effect of number of participants is SubjectEffects.m .

Data sets are divided in the following way:

FallsSensorsData contains the accelerometer, gyroscope data for the real falls

FallsL contains extracted features that were obtained after pre-processing sensors data, and this is the file that is used for analysis

peak_ADL, peak_real and peak_sim contains the peak value of the acceleration in each clip for ADL, real and simulated falls

DeepTable data sets contain the extracted features for ADL and simulated falls, divided in categories
